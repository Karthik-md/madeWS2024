Did the U.S. and China trade war result in economic
decoupling? A Data-Driven Analysis
Introduction
For decades, the economic interdependence between China and the U.S. has been profound. Recent tensions
from 2018 to 2022 due raise in tariff for chinese imports by US president Donald Trump government raise the
question: Are their economies drifting apart? The answer is mixed. U.S. imports of certain Chinese goods, like
semiconductors and IT hardware, have dropped, while imports of laptops, phones, and toys have surged,
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade policies and a push to diversify supply chains contribute to
this partial disentanglement. However, these actions come with repercussions, including supply chain
disruptions and increased costs. Let's interpret these actions further.
Used Data:
Pipeline A:
This pipeline imports tariffs applied on each quantity based on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), a U.S.
system for classifying imported goods. For example, HTS Code 8471.30.01 classifies laptops and portable
computers. The pipeline classifies the imports in time series and categories based on HTS codes. This dataset
is intended for public access and use. License: us-pd

Pipeline B:

been used more. The license will be strictly followed by me by providing citations, un-manipulated and

Analysis

2 / 4
By calculating the percentage of goods which was imported gives us the amount of consumptions by US. The
slope of the graph is calculated, using linear regression to understand the rate of change in imports over time.
Mapping this slope with percentage changes quantifies the impact of tariffs.
Plot 1
The analysis done based on tariffs applied on group of Lists like List 1, 2, 3 with 25% raise in tariff, list 4A with
7.5% tariff where US government put tariff only on these Chinese list of products and rest of the world with no
tariff.
Figure 1: US imports from Rest of World and China in 2018-2022
As expected, the trade war has had the largest impact on imports from China of products hit with the highest
US tariffs. US imports from China of goods currently facing a 25 percent duty (Lists 1, 2, and 3) remain 22
percent below pre-trade war levels. US imports of those same products from the rest of the world are now 34
percent higher. US imports from China of products currently subject to 7.5 percent tariffs (List 4A) remain 3
percent below levels in August 2019 (right before the imposition of tariffs on those products), whereas
comparable imports from the rest of the world are now 45 percent higher.
Plot 2
Beginning in 2020, COVID-19 lockdowns led many Americans to work, school, and play from home, which
sharply increased demand for certain products, many of which were imported predominately from China.
These are the lists that had no tariff imposed and show little evidence of decoupling as there are no decrease
in imports compared to rest of the world.

Conclusions
Yes, decoupling has happened and affected Chinese supply chain from these plots. For some products, the
evidence here shows the United States increasingly sourcing imports assembled in countries other than China.
The United States now buys more expensive imports from third countries that it once bought but no longer
buys from China because of the tariffs. The changes in imports shown here are consistent with other evidence
that rest of the world, are now trading more, including with the United States, in response to the US-China
trade war. US tariffs are not the only “cause” of the United States importing less from China. Some laborintensive
production closely associated with much of the clothing and footwear industry was likely relocating
anyway, following a trend that was visible even before the trade war. Policymakers therefore need to interpret
even this preliminary evidence of some US-China “decoupling” with extreme caution.
