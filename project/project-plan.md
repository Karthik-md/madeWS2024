## Title
Analyzing the Impact of the U.S.-China Trade War on Commodity Inflation in the U.S. Market

## Main Question

How has the U.S.-China trade war influenced the inflation trends of commodities in the U.S. market?

## Description

This project seeks to explore the effect of the U.S.-China trade war on the inflation of key commodities in the U.S. market. With escalating trade tensions, tariffs, and trade policy changes, the prices of various goods, from agricultural products to manufactured goods, have fluctuated. By analyzing historical commodity price data before, during, and after the major trade conflicts, we aim to understand the correlation between trade war events and inflationary trends. The project will utilize open-source economic and trade data, applying data analysis methods such as time series analysis, regression modeling, and correlation techniques. The outcomes of this analysis can provide valuable insights for economists, policymakers, and businesses to understand the broader economic consequences of trade disputes.

## Datasources
Datasource1: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics - Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Metadata URL: BLS CPI Data
Data URL: BLS CPI Dataset
Data Type: CSV
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, including commodities. This dataset will be used to track inflation trends for key commodities over time.
Datasource2: U.S. International Trade Commission - Trade Data
Metadata URL: USITC Trade Data
Data URL: USITC Data Portal
Data Type: CSV, Excel
This dataset provides detailed U.S. trade data, including import and export values, tariff rates, and the volume of goods traded between the U.S. and China. This will be crucial for identifying trade war events and their direct impact on commodity prices.
Datasource3: World Bank - Commodity Prices
Metadata URL: World Bank Commodity Data
Data URL: World Bank Commodity Price Dataset
Data Type: CSV
This source provides global commodity price data, allowing the comparison of U.S. commodity price changes against global trends, helping to isolate the specific impact of the U.S.-China trade war.
