## Title
Analyzing the Impact of the U.S.-China Trade War on Commodity Inflation in the U.S. Market

## Main Question

How has the U.S.-China trade war influenced the inflation trends of commodities in the U.S. market?

## Description

This project seeks to explore the effect of the U.S.-China trade war on the inflation of key commodities in the U.S. market. With escalating trade tensions, tariffs, and trade policy changes, the prices of various goods, from agricultural products to manufactured goods, have fluctuated. By analyzing historical commodity price data before, during, and after the major trade conflicts, we aim to understand the correlation between trade war events and inflationary trends. The project will utilize open-source economic and trade data, applying data analysis methods such as time series analysis, regression modeling, and correlation techniques. The outcomes of this analysis can provide valuable insights for economists, policymakers, and businesses to understand the broader economic consequences of trade disputes.
